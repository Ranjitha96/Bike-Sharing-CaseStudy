## Problem Statement:  

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes a Mobility Services firm has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Business Goal:  

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- For variable season, we can clearly see that the category 3 : Fall, has the highest median, which shows that the demand was high during this season. It is least for 1: spring.
- For variable year.The year 2019 had a higher count of users as compared to the year 2018.
- For variable holiday.The count of users is less during the holidays.
- For variable weekday.The count of rentals is almost even throughout the week.
- For the variable "Workingday" , in the boxplot we can see those maximum bookings happening between 4000 and 6000, that is the median count of users is constant almost throughout the week. There is not much of difference in booking whether its working day or not.
- For the variable weathersit.There are no users when there is heavy rain/ snow indicating that this weather is quite adverse. Highest count was seen when the weather situation was Clear, Partly Cloudy.
- For the variable month.The number of rentals peaked in September. This observation is consistent with the observations made regarding the weather. As a result of the typical substantial snowfall in December, rentals may have declined.

## <font color = 'red'> Recommendation</font>
- The months - Jan,Feb,May,Sep should be considered by the company as they have a higher demand as compared to other months.<br>
- With an increase in temperature the demand also increases, hence it should keep track of the weather conditions.<br>
- Develop targeted marketing and pricing strategies for different seasons, particularly emphasizing promotions during Summer and Winter<br>
- Implement weather-specific promotions or incentives to encourage bike usage during favorable weather conditions, addressing the impact of temp and windspeed.<br>
- During the Winter season the demand rises, hence it should be well prepared to meet the high demand.<br>
- Holiday time seems to be least interesting for biking, little motavation and marketing might help here.<br>
